Skier Schedule

(This problem appeared in the June 2021 issue of the Mensa Bulletin)

Debbie and her three friends each belong to a different ski club -- the Chiefs, the Nurses, the Seniors, ad the Teachers. Each club organized a ski trip to a 
different European country: Austria, France, Germany, and Switzerland. Two clubs were traveling on March 5. One club was traveling on March 8. The last club was 
traveling on March 10.

1. The four friends are Amanda, Carol, a member of the Chiefs, and a woman who is going to Germany.

2. The Nurses are not traveling on March 10.

3. The Nurses and the Teachers travel on different dates.

4. The Chiefs and Seniors are not traveling on March 10.

5. Amanda and Belinda are not traveling on March 10.

7. Neither the Seniors nor the club that is going to Austria are traveling on March 5.
